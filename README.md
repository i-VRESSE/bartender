## [Step-by-step setup of proof-of-concept](#step-by-step-setup-of-proof-of-concept)

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/i-VRESSE/bartender.git
    cd bartender
    ```

2. Make a python virtual environment

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install poetry

    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```

4. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

5. Run the application and the database

    ```bash
    bartender serve
    ```

    Important: **In another terminal**

    ```bash
    docker run \
        -p "5432:5432" \
        -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bartender" \
        -e "POSTGRES_USER=bartender" \
        -e "POSTGRES_DB=bartender" \
        postgres:13.6-bullseye
    ```

6. Migrate the database

    ```bash
    alembic upgrade "head"
    ```

7. Go to the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI

    <http://localhost:8000/api/docs>

8. Create a job with:

    ```bash
    $ curl -X 'PUT' \
      'http://localhost:8000/api/job/' \
      -H 'accept: */*' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"name": "my_fist_job"}' \
      -v

    *   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
    > PUT /api/job/ HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8000
    > User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
    > accept: */*
    > Content-Type: application/json
    > Content-Length: 23
    >
    * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
    < HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    < date: Fri, 26 Aug 2022 11:24:05 GMT
    < server: uvicorn
    < location: http://localhost:8000/api/job/1
    < transfer-encoding: chunked
    <
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
    ```

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## [Poetry](#poetry)

This project uses poetry. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run bartender serve
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: <https://python-poetry.org/>

## [Docker](#docker)

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . build
```

## [Project structure](#project-structure)

```bash
$ tree "bartender"
bartender
├── conftest.py         # Fixtures for all tests.
├── db                  # module contains db configurations
│   ├── dao             # Data Access Objects. Contains different classes to interact with database.
│   └── models          # Package contains different models for ORMs.
├── __main__.py         # Startup script. Starts uvicorn.
├── services            # Package for different external services such as rabbit or redis etc.
├── settings.py         # Main configuration settings for project.
├── static              # Static content.
├── tests               # Tests for project.
└── web                 # Package contains web server. Handlers, startup config.
    ├── api             # Package with all handlers.
    │   └── router.py   # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifetime.py     # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## [Configuration](#configuration)

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "BARTENDER\_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "bartender/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "BARTENDER_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behavior can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `bartender.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:

```bash
BARTENDER_RELOAD="True"
BARTENDER_PORT="8000"
BARTENDER_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/>

## [Pre-commit](#pre-commit)

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

By default it runs:

* black (formats your code);
* mypy (validates types);
* isort (sorts imports in all files);
* flake8 (spots possible bugs);
* yesqa (removes useless `# noqa` comments).

You can read more about pre-commit here: <https://pre-commit.com/>

## [Migrations](#migrations)

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:

```bash
# To run all migrations until the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:

```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:

```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate

# For empty file generation.
alembic revision
```

## [Running tests](#running-tests)

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . run --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```

For running tests on your local machine.

1. you need to start a database.

    I prefer doing it with docker:

    ```text
    docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bartender" -e "POSTGRES_USER=bartender" -e "POSTGRES_DB=bartender" postgres:13.6-bullseye
    ```

2. Run the pytest.

    ```bash
    pytest -vv .
    ```

To get PostgreSQL terminal do

```bash
docker exec -ti <id or name of docker container> psql -U bartender
```

## [User management](#user-management)

For secure auth add `BARTENDER_SECRET=<some random string>` to `.env` file.

The web service can be configured to authenticated via GitHub and/or Orcid.

After you have setup a social login described in sub chapter below then you can authenticate with

```text
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/auth/<name of social login>/authorize' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

This will return an authorization URL, which should be opened in web browser.

After visiting social authentication page you will get a JSON response with an access token.

This access token can be used on protected routes with

```text
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/users/profile' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <the access token>'
```

### [GitHub login](#github-login)

The web service can be configured to login with your [GitHub](https://gibhub.com) account.

To enable perform following steps:

1. Create a GitHub app
    1. Goto <https://github.com/settings/apps/new>
    2. Set Homepage URL to `http://localhost:8000/`
    3. Set Callback URL to `http://localhost:8000/auth/github/callback`
    4. Check `Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation`
    5. In Webhook section
        1. Uncheck `Active`
    6. In User permissions section
        1. Set `Email addresses` to `Read-only`
    7. Press `Create GitHub App` button
    8. After creation
        1. Generate a new client secret
        2. (Optionally) Restrict app to certain IP addresses
2. Append GitHub app credentials to `.env` file
    1. Add `BARTENDER_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<Client id of GitHub app>`
    2. Add `BARTENDER_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret of GitHub app>`

### [Orcid sandbox login](#orcid-sandbox-login)

The web service can be configured to login with your [Orcid sandbox](https://sandbox.orcid.org/) account.

To enable perform following steps:

1. Create Orcid account for yourself
   1. Goto [https://sandbox.orcid.org/](https://sandbox.orcid.org/)
       * Use `<something>@mailinator.com` as email, because to register app you need a verified email and Orcid sandbox only sends mails to `mailinator.com`.
   2. Goto [https://www.mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp](https://www.mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp) and search for `<something>` and verify your email address
   3. Goto [https://sandbox.orcid.org/account](https://sandbox.orcid.org/account), make email public for everyone
2. Create application
   1. Goto [https://sandbox.orcid.org/developer-tools](https://sandbox.orcid.org/developer-tools) to register app.
       * Only one app can be registered per orcid account, so use alternate account when primary account already has an registered app.
       * Your website URL
           * Does not allow localhost URL, so use `https://github.com/i-VRESSE/bartender`
       * Redirect URI
           * For dev deployments set to `http://localhost:8000/auth/orcidsandbox/callback`
3. Append Orcid sandbox app credentials to `.env` file
     1. Add `BARTENDER_ORCIDSANDBOX_CLIENT_ID=<Client id of Orcid sandbox app>`
     2. Add `BARTENDER_ORCIDSANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret of Orcid sandbox app>`

The `GET /api/users/profile` route will return the Orcid ID in `oauth_accounts[oauth_name=sandbox.orcid.org].account_id`.

### [Orcid login](#orcid-login)

The web service can be configured to login with your [Orcid](https://orcid.org/) account.

Steps are similar to [Orcid sandbox login](#orcid-sandbox-login), but

* Callback URL must use **https** scheme
* Account emails don't have to be have be from `@mailinator.com` domain.
* In steps
  * Replace `https://sandbox.orcid.org/` with `https://orcid.org/`
  * In redirect URL replace `orcidsandbox` with `orcid`.
  * In `.env` replace `_ORCIDSANDBOX_` with `_ORCID_`

### [Super user](#super-user)

When a user has `is_superuser is True` then he/she can manage users and make other users also super users.

However you need a first super user. This can be done by running

```text
bartender super <email address of logged in user>
```

## [Job](#job)

### [Calling bartender](#calling-bartender)

To interact with the bartender web service the job needs to authenticate itself.
Authentication is done by passing a JWT token in the HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
The job can find a token in the `./meta` file.
This token belongs to the user that submitted it.

For example to submit another job do something like

```shell
TOKEN=$(tail -1 ./meta)
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/job/' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "string"
}'
```
