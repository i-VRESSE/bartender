## Step-by-step setup of proof-of-concept

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-VRESSE/bartender.git
cd bartender
```

2. Make a python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install poetry

```bash
pip install poetry
```

4. Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

5. Run the application and the database

```bash
python -m bartender
```

**In another terminal**

```bash
docker run \
    -p "5432:5432" \
    -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bartender" \
    -e "POSTGRES_USER=bartender" \
    -e "POSTGRES_DB=bartender" \
    postgres:13.6-bullseye
```

6. Migrate the database

```bash
alembic upgrade "head"
```

8. Go to the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI

-   http://localhost:8000/api/docs

Create a job with:

```bash
$ curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/job/' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "my_fist_job"}' \
  -v

*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> PUT /api/job/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
> accept: */*
> Content-Type: application/json

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## Poetry

This project uses poetry. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m bartender
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . build
```

## Project structure

```bash
$ tree "bartender"
bartender
├── conftest.py  # Fixtures for all tests.
├── db  # module contains db configurations
│   ├── dao  # Data Access Objects. Contains different classes to inteact with database.
│   └── models  # Package contains different models for ORMs.
├── __main__.py  # Startup script. Starts uvicorn.
├── services  # Package for different external services such as rabbit or redis etc.
├── settings.py  # Main configuration settings for project.
├── static  # Static content.
├── tests  # Tests for project.
└── web  # Package contains web server. Handlers, startup config.
    ├── api  # Package with all handlers.
    │   └── router.py  # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifetime.py  # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variabels should start with "BARTENDER\_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "bartender/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "BARTENDER_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `bartender.settings.Settings.Config`.

An exmaple of .env file:

```bash
BARTENDER_RELOAD="True"
BARTENDER_PORT="8000"
BARTENDER_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:

-   black (formats your code);
-   mypy (validates types);
-   isort (sorts imports in all files);
-   flake8 (spots possibe bugs);
-   yesqa (removes useless `# noqa` comments).

You can read more about pre-commit here: https://pre-commit.com/

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:

```bash
# To run all migrations untill the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:

```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:

```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate

# For empty file generation.
alembic revision
```

## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . run --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```

For running tests on your local machine.

1. you need to start a database.

I prefer doing it with docker:

```
docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bartender" -e "POSTGRES_USER=bartender" -e "POSTGRES_DB=bartender" postgres:13.6-bullseye
```

2. Run the pytest.

```bash
pytest -vv .
```
