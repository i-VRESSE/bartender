Bartender is a middleware web service to schedule jobs on various infrastructures.

The bartender is a web service that offers to run command line applications for
visitors. The application input should be a configuration file with links to
data files in the same directory. After authenticating with your local account
or social login like ORCID or GitHub, you can upload your configuration file and
data files as an archive to the web service for submission. Once the application
has been executed the output files can be browsed with a web browser.

Bartender can be configured to run applications on a Slurm batch scheduler,
pilot job framework, the grid or in the cloud. Bartender will take care of
moving the input and output files to the right place. To pick where an
application should be run you can choose from a list of existing Python
functions or supply your own.

Bartender can be used as the computational backend for a web application, the
web application should guide visitors into the submission and show the results.

## Quickstart

1. Install bartender via github:

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/i-VRESSE/bartender.git
    ```

1. Obtain a copy of the example configuration file

    ```
    curl -o config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-VRESSE/bartender/main/config-example.yaml
    ```

1. In another terminal, start up a database for storing users and jobs.

    ```bash
    docker run \
        -p "5432:5432" \
        -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bartender" \
        -e "POSTGRES_USER=bartender" \
        -e "POSTGRES_DB=bartender" \
        postgres:13.6-bullseye
    ```

1. Create tables in the database

    ```bash
    alembic upgrade "head"
    ```

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    bartender serve
    ```

1. Go to the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI

    <http://localhost:8000/api/docs>


## Consuming web service

The interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI is at <http://localhost:8000/api/docs>

To consume the bartender web service you need to authenticate yourself.
Authentication is done by passing a JWT token in the HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in the HTTP request.
This token can be aquired by using the register+login routes or using a [socal login](#user-management).

### Word count example

Bartender is by default configured with a word count applicaton.
Use the following steps to run a job:

1. Create an archive to submit. The zip file should contain a file called `README.md`. A zip file could be created in a clone of this repo with `zip README.zip README.md`.
2. Start [bartender web service and postgresql server](#step-by-step-setup-of-proof-of-concept)
3. Register & login account by
    1. Goto `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs` and
    2. Try out the `POST /auth/register` route.
    3. Use default request body and press execute button. This will create an account with email `user@example.com` and password `string`.
    4. Use authorize button on top of page to login with username `user@example.com` and password `string`.
4. Submit archive.
    1. Try out the `POST /api/application/{application}/job` route.
    2. Use `wc` as application parameter
    3. Upload the `README.zip` as request body.
    4. Press execute button
    5. The response contains a job identifier (`id` property) that can be used to fetch the job state.
5. Fetch job state
    1. Try out the `GET /api/job/{jobid}`
    2. Use job identifier retrieved by submit request as `jobid` parameter value.
        * When job state is equal to `ok` the job was completed succesfully.
6. Retrieve result. The word count application (`wc`) outputs to the stdout.
    1. Try out the `GET /api/job/{jobid}/stdout`
    2. Use job identifier retrieved by submit request as `jobid` parameter value.
    3. Should see something like `433  1793 14560 README.md`.
        Where numbers are counts for newlines, words, bytes.

### Haddock3 example

To test with haddock3 use
```shell
export BARTENDER_APPLICATIONS='{"haddock3": {"command": "haddock3 $config", "config": "workflow.cfg"}}'
bartender serve
```
Bartender expects the haddock3 executable to be in its PATH.

Submit a job in another terminal in a directory with a zip file with a `workflow.cfg` file and its data files.

Examples at https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/examples .
```shell
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/applications/haddock3/job' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'upload=@docking-protein-protein.zip;type=application/x-zip-compressed'
```
Where `docking-protein-protein.zip` is the zip file to run haddock3 with.

The response contains a redirect to the job url (`/api/job/<some id>`).

The job url should be fetched until the state property is either `ok` or `error`.
