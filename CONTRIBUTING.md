# Contributing guidelines

We welcome any kind of contribution to our software, from simple comment or
question to a full fledged [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). In case you
feel like can make a valuable contribution, but you you need help with any of
the steps below: don't let this discourage you; we can help!

## Questions and bug reports

The preferred method for asking and answering questions is through our [GitHub
issue tracker](https://github.com/i-VRESSE/bartender/issues). Before opening a
new issue, please use the search functionality to see of someone already filed
the same issue. You may add add "Question" label to your issue (or others, when
relevant.)

If you think you may have found a bug, you can follow the same instructions
using the "bug" label instead. Try to include all relevant information, such as
the version of bartender and potential configuration files. Ideally, try to
provide a minimal set of instructions to reproduce the problem.

## Code contributions

   start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;
1. (**important**) wait until some kind of concensus is reached about your idea
   being a good idea;

1. make sure the existing tests still work and add new tests (if necessary);
1. update or expand the documentation;
1. make sure your code follows the style guidelines;
